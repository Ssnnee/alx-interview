#  0x09. Island Perimeter
`Algorithm` `Python`

## Concepts needed

1. 2D Arrays (Matrices):
    - Accessing and iterating over elements in a 2D array.
    - Understanding how to navigate through adjacent cells (horizontally and vertically).

2. Conditional Logic:
    - Applying conditions to determine whether a cell contributes to the perimeter of the island.

3.  Counting Techniques:
    - Developing a method to count the edges that contribute to the islandâ€™s perimeter.

4.  Problem-Solving Strategies:
    - Breaking down the problem into smaller tasks, such as identifying land cells and calculating their contribution to the perimeter.

5.  Python Programming:
    - Nested loops for iterating over grid cells.
    - Conditional statements to check the status of adjacent cells.
