# 0x03. Log Parsing

This project involves reading from standard input (stdin), handling data in a
specific format, and performing calculations based on the input data.

## Topics
- Python
- Algorithm

## Concepts
Here are a few things to consider when implementing this project:
- File I/O in Python
- Signal Handling in Python
- Data Processing
- Regular Expressions
- Dictionaries in Python
- Exception Handling

> [!NOTE]
> Could not handle wrong format. Should probably use regex to success
>

## How to use
- First need to make the files executable :
```bash
chmod +x 0-generator.py 0-stats.py
```
- Then run the generator and stats
```bash
./0-generator.py | ./0-stats.py
```
