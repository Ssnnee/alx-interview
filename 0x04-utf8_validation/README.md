# 0x04. UTF-8 Validation

Algorithm Python

## Description

[UTF-8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8) is a variable-length character encoding standard used for electronic
communication.

In this project, we need to to validate whether a given dataset represents a
valid UTF-8 encoding.

## Concepts

Here some useful concepts to consider for this project:

- Bitwise Operations in Python: [Python Bitwise Operators](https://intranet.alxswe.com/rltoken/BslyYNZlXdyxW3_b0WNOcg)
- UTF-8 Encoding Scheme
- Data Representation
- List Manipulation in Python: [Python Lists](https://intranet.alxswe.com/rltoken/TaN91MgmOL80GeOGvmldIw)
- Boolean logic

## How to test

To test the code, you can use the provided `0-main.py` file.
Fist, you need to make it executable:

```bash
chmod +x 0-main.py
```

Then, you can run the program:

```bash
./0-main.py
```
